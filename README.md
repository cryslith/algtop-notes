# algtop-notes

These are notes on algebraic topology, originally livetexed from Haynes
Miller's 18.905-906 course sequence offered at MIT in the 2016-2017 academic
year. Eventually, this will turn into a publishable book.

* Confirm with skd beforehand if you are planning on making any changes to ``header.tex``.
* To compile after cloning, run:

```
$ pdflatex main.tex
```

Also: I've copied <https://github.com/hoodmane/spectralsequences/> here, so
that Hood's package compiles on my computer.

## Update as of Feb 22, 2018

Haynes edited a lot of the notes for the first half of the book. skd manually
merged Haynes' edits/rewritings into main.tex. A preface, written by Haynes,
was added. The old version of the notes from 18.905 have been added into
`old-905`.
